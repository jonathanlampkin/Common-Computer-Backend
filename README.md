<h1>Twitter Tweets Summarizer and Sentiment Classifier By Jonathan Lampkin</h1>

In this repository is the code used to build the backend of the [People's Thoughts](https://main-common-computer-jonathanlampkin.endpoint.ainize.ai/) program deployed on [Ainize](https://ainize.ai/).

*How to use this backend:*

1. git clone https://github.com/jonathanlampkin/Common-Computer-Backend.git

2. cd Common-Computer-Backend

3. docker build --tag {project-name}:{tag} . 

4. docker run -p 8000:8000 {project-name}:{tag} 



This program will quickly and simply summarize what twitter users have to say about whatever topic you want and show you how others feel about it.

The program can be found here: https://main-common-computer-jonathanlampkin.endpoint.ainize.ai/

To use the program simply enter any search phrase into the search bar and click Enter.
